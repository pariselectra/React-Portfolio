# React-Portfolio

## Description
This portfolio uses REACT to showcase my individual projects. I created this portfolio based off of a portfolio I had created prior using CSS and HTML. REACT allows the site to be more responsive. Additionally, I added stylized images to represent each project I created.

## Installation
